
Data Collection:

1.) Crime

 - NYC Open Data Hub Api Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i
 - Use the RSocrata library to extract data
 - Below is the line of code. It takes approximately 10 minutes to extract data from year 2020 to 2022. It's about 850k rows.
 - crime_data <- read.socrata("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/qgea-i56i.json?$where=cmplnt_fr_dt between \'2020\' and \'2022\'")

2.) Twitter

	- We've a limited 10 mil quota of tweets for a academi account. I've another two academic accounts which limited to 7 days of tweets and 1 mil quota of tweets. 
	- I'm not sure the size of tweets from year 2020 to 2022 in NYC region. I'll figure it out over this weekend.
	- Due to limited quota, I'll share my third academic account if you guys want to play around with it using Rtweets library. Below are the codes:
 	- library(rtweet)
	  appname <- "JAS"
	  key <- "y35IoaX6uRqG0SHevdkcOwwz0"
	  secret <- "LTJZX1OYgodqGJRtSnURXP550JIVQSDmnvQR54whvQeVNY8M6e"
	  access_token <- "600477513-IxVeKsm8EiOhmoPNHLj0jjW0YBs43Hw4MFKeQE74"
	  access_secret <- "heeGBjyWQNiZOMyrwNCEM9xU7fxMxZJa69UFtX22Ba2qe"

	 twitter_token <- create_token(
  	 app = appname,
         consumer_key = key,
         consumer_secret = secret,
         access_token = access_token,
         access_secret = access_secret)
	 search_tweets('',n=1500, geocode="40.730610,-73.935242,5mi", since = '2022-08-01')
	
	- I'll share with you guys other access once I'm sure we have enough quota for everyone to play around or once I've download NYC tweets to a csv file. 
	- Other access requires this library(academictwitteR) as it uses advacence api technology.
